        <h1>THROUGH MY LENS</h1>
        <p>The idea behind this page is to raise awareness about the effects of war and the impact that it has on peoples lives.</p>
        <p>We tell the stories of this people through photography and what it has been for them being in such spaces.</p>
        <p>More often than not we fail to acknowledge the victims and hail the veterans who put their lives ahead while protecting people. We want to acknowledge such people and give them a voice through photography.</p>
